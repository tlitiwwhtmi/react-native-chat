# react-native-chat
A chat program wrote with react-native .
I am a newer to react-native , and I found it is more efficient to learn react-native with writing a program (Actully it goes well with other language). So , I wrote this chat program use react-native and websocket and named it "Around". The program is not very good , but it works well on iphone (I test it) . If you are a newer to react-native , I think it is not bad to take a look at this project .
